**HEART DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM**

**1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES** <br>
The heart disease prediction system was intended to develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to detect the heart disease of a patient and also predict the risk level of that patient with more accuracy. 

**2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS** <br>
After the heart disease prediction system completed, we have tested the accuracy of the system which is more than 70%.

**3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE**
The projects member sticks to the Gantt chart scheduled so, the actual fits the original schedule.

**4.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL BUDGET**

The actual budget matches the initial budget, indicating that the team adhered to the budget established at the start of the project and did not overspend.

**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE** <br>
The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, the system is not able to detect complex heart disease of patient. The system also scope down the limit of only heart disease detection.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES** <br>
Our system managed to achieve the objectives initialized since the beginning of the project. A system that is artificial intelligence powered, which uses machine learning algorithm has been made. The motivation for the system was to  find  the  most  efficient  ML  algorithm  for detection of heart diseases. This system compares the accuracy score of Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms for predicting heart disease using UCI machine learning repository dataset. The result of this study indicates that the Random Forest algorithm is the most efficient algorithm with accuracy  score  of  70%  for prediction  of  heart  disease.

**5.3 IMPACTS** <br>
By creating this system, the time reduced for patient to detect his heart disease and also the risk level of his sufferings. It will help the people to decide more quickly to consult with doctor. In all over the world, heart disease is a dangerous disease because people detect the disease lately. So people will more concerned about his heart condition and calculate his risk level almost accurately without any complex test system.

**5.4 TRANSITION PLAN** <br>
Our Staff will provide support when require, The main work of support provide by our staff are shown below:
1)Maintain the system
2)Handling errors and updates of the system
3)Provides users guidelines
4)Report information to senior management on monthly basis

#### 4. Close Contract <br>
