# Implementation

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN

### Deliverables:

#### Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware we used our laptop which is consists of intel core I5 8th Gen + 4GB RAM + SSD to implement our project.


#### Software Requirement:
For the software, we used Jupiter platform to code the python program for the AI module which is predicting the heart disease and displaying the output. The database we used is took from UCI machine learning repository which is the Cleveland Dataset


#### Prediction System Technique:
There are many machine learning algorithms to perform this analysis, but we will be doing this with Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Binary classification technique. 


#### Outcome of the project:
First step of this project will be retrieve data from the database which consists of the patient details and stages of the heart disease. The binary classification is only consist of 2 classes which is 0 and 1. 0 represents there is no heart disease and 1 represents have heart disease. We used the sigmoid activation function to classify the data as above 0.5 are heart disease and below are non. At last we used graph chart to find the accuracy of the binary classification. Then display the output if it has accuracy over 70%.
